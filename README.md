# Financial-risk-forecasting-system
This project showcases my journey to build an end-to-end financial analytics system that pulls market data, builds forecasting and risk models, and exposes insights through APIs and dashboards.

I’m building this project to:
- Learn time-series data analysis
- Understand basic financial risk concepts
- Practice writing clean, structured Python code
- Learn how data → model → API → dashboard systems are built

 Current Status
- [x] Pull historical stock price data
- [x] Visualize price trends
- [ ] Add basic risk metrics (volatility)
- [ ] Build forecasting models
- [ ] Expose results via an API
- [ ] Create an interactive dashboard
- [ ] Create a pipleine to streamline changes
- [ ] Docker Containerization

Tech Stack (Planned)
- Python
- pandas, numpy
- yfinance
- matplotlib / plotly
- FastAPI
- Streamlit

## Notes
This is a learning-focused project. The goal is clarity, iteration, and improvement.
